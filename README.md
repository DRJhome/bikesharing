Overview:
 This project is to determine the viability of Bike sharing in Des Moines, using the data from New York Citi Bike data.
Results:
The results are clear that there is enough of a market and interest in the Bike Sharing industry for it to work in Des Moines. The NYC city bike sharing had 2,344,224 bike rentals in one month in NYC.  This was very popular in tourist areas.

Bike sharing was also popular throughout the day, with a window for repairs from 2am-5am.
 
Over 1.9 million of the rides were by subscriber, showing a demand for not only tourists, but the local residents to use this service as well.
 
Bike sharing was very popular, and broke down by the genders as follows:
•	Men were 65% of the users
•	Women were 25% of the users
•	Unknown accounted for 10% of the users. 
Summary:
 In conclusion, Bikeshare services are extremely popular in busy metropolitan areas. These areas often have overly packed and scarce parking, resulting in Bikeshare services to be a great alternative to driving and other forms of public transport. The market is solid for male users and looking at attracting female users would be great to increase the overall use of this service.
